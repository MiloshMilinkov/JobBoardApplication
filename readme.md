# Job Board Application

This project is a simple Job Board Application created to learn and demonstrate the interaction between a Vue.js frontend and a Node.js backend with a SQLite database. The application allows companies to post job listings and users to apply for jobs.

## Features

- **Vue.js Frontend:** 
  - Display job postings
  - Search and filter jobs by category
  - Application tracking for users

- **Node.js Backend:**
  - RESTful API using Express.js
  - SQLite database for storing job posts and applications
  - User authentication and role-based access (job seekers, employers)(change?)
  - Repository pattern to manage database interactions
